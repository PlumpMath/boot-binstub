* Boot-binstub

** Proof of concept

This is a proof of concept for a stub generating facility for *boot-clj*.

** Concept

- Boot-clj creates a bin directory under *BOOT_HOME*.
- User adds *$BOOT_HOME/bin* directory to his path. 
- User leverages Bootâ€™s built-in facility to define a *-main* method in build.boot.
- User imports the task in *build.boot* or *profile.boot*
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(set-env!
 :dependencies '[[danielsz/boot-binstubs "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]])
(require '[danielsz.binstubs :refer [binstub]])
#+END_SRC
- User types in any boot-clj project:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
boot binstub -r RELEASE
#+END_SRC
Where release is the name of the stub that will be generated. 

Quod Erat Demonstrandum: user can invoke his Clojure application from anywhere in the shell.

** Note to boot-clj contributors

If we decide to adopt this approach, please open issues so I can start refining the functionality. 
Pull requests welcome, too.
